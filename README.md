# Soft Jaws for [Rockler 9in Quick Release Workbench Vise](https://www.rockler.com/rockler-9-quick-release-workbench-vise)

Print in TPU and vary infill % to adjust overall stiffness.  Unlike softwood soft jaws, TPU will never splinter and will return to its original shape after deforming when clamping irregular shaped objects.  TPU is very resistant to abrasion damage and won't mar the surface of the object you are clamping.

The model includes a V-block style cutout horizontally across the face and two vertically positioned between the screw and guide bars for clamping long round stock.
